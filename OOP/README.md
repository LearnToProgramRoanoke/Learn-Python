### OOP - Building Your Own Classes, Constructors and Methods

An adaptation of the Zombie-House game using Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

There are many good resources for learning OOP. These examples are based on a course developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation:
[Object-oriented Programming in Python: Create Your Own Adventure Game](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/object-oriented-principles). This is a free course and enrollment is open several times a year.

This library contains classes that can be used to create objects in the game such as rooms and items to be placed into the player's inventory. By using the Adventurelib library, you are beginning to learn the use of Object-Oriented Programming.

**New Concepts:**

* Classes
  1. Room()
  2. Item()
  3. Character()

* Constructors
  1. __init__
  2. attributes
  3. instances

* Getters

* Setters
