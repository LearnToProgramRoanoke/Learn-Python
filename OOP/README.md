### OOP - Building Your Own Classes, Constructors and Methods

An adaptation of the Zombie-House game using Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

There are many good resources for learning OOP. These examples are based on a course developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation:
[Object-oriented Programming in Python: Create Your Own Adventure Game](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/object-oriented-principles). This is a free course and enrollment is open several times a year.

In the original Zombie House game, information about the rooms, items in a room and non-playable characters were stored inside a Python dictionary. With OOP, these components of the game are created by constructing an instance of each object contained within a Class. Each object that is created can have attributes (exits in a room, types of items in a room, friendly and enemy characters).

**New Concepts:**

* Classes
  1. Room()
  2. Item()
  3. Character()

* Constructors
  1. \_\_init\_\_
  2. attributes
  3. instances

* Getters

* Setters
